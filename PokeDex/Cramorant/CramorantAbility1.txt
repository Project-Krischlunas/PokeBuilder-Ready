Gulp Missile: When using Surf or Dive, it will change into Gulping Form if it has over 50% max HP or Gorging Form if it has less than 50% max HP. If hit afterwards, form reverts and it shoots out its prey to attack, doing 1/4th of opponent's maximum HP in damage. If the Cramorant was in Gulping Form, the opponent's Defense is lowered 1 stage. If the Cramorant was in Gorging Form, the opponent is paralyzed.
